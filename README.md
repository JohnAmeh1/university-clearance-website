🎓 University Clearance Website

A streamlined, secure, and efficient web application designed to automate the final year clearance process for graduating students.

🚀 Project Overview

The University Clearance Website is a web-based system built to digitize and simplify the clearance process for final year students. Traditionally, this process involves a lot of paperwork, departmental visits, and manual tracking — resulting in delays, errors, and inefficiencies.

This system replaces the manual approach with a centralized, user-friendly platform where students can submit clearance requests, departments can approve or reject them, and administrators can monitor progress in real-time.

🔧 Key Features

🧑‍🎓 Student Dashboard: View clearance status, submit required documents, and track departmental approvals.

🔐 Admin Panel: Review student submissions, approve or reject requests, and provide comments, manage departments, users, and monitor clearance activities system-wide.

📄 Digital Clearance Certificate: Automatically generated upon full approval.

📨 Email Notifications: Notify users of status updates and actions required.

🛡️ Authentication & Role-Based Access: Secure login with role-based access for students and admins.

💡 Project Objectives

Eliminate paper-based clearance delays.

Provide transparency and accountability in the clearance process.

Simplify administrative work with automated approvals and centralized records.

Ensure data integrity and student record security.
